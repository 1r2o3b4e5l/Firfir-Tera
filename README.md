Description:
Firfir tera is a web app that gives you instant access to local and international recipes. Just log in and start preparing delicious meals following the step-by-step procedures posted by kitchen enthusiasts all over the world.

We've decided to use MongoDB as our database for the recipe app due to its flexibility and scalability. 
As our entities don't have **strong relationships and complex transactions between** them using MongoDB's document-oriented structure aligns perfectly with the use case of our project.
