Description:
Firfir tera is a web app that gives you instant access to local and international recipes. Just log in and start preparing delicious meals following the step-by-step procedures posted by kitchen enthusiasts all over the world.
Firfir Tera stands as an innovative web application dedicated to offering a comprehensive collection of local and international recipes. It serves as a one-stop destination for culinary enthusiasts seeking instant access to diverse and delicious meals. Users simply log in to the platform and gain access to an array of meticulously detailed recipes, featuring step-by-step procedures, ingredient lists, serving sizes, and captivating visuals.

We've decided to use MongoDB as our database for the recipe app due to its flexibility and scalability. 
As our entities don't have **strong relationships and complex transactions between** them using MongoDB's document-oriented structure aligns perfectly with the use case of our project.
The platform's user-friendly interface ensures easy exploration of recipes, catering to both novice cooks and seasoned chefs. Firfir Tera's primary focus is to provide an extensive repertoire of recipes, covering everything from traditional family favorites to contemporary culinary trends.

To support its vast collection of recipes and associated data, Firfir Tera has opted for MongoDB as its database solution. MongoDB's document-oriented structure aligns seamlessly with the app's needs, offering the flexibility and scalability required to store and manage a wide variety of recipes while adapting to evolving culinary trends and user preferences. Our recipe sharing webapp employes html, bootstrap and typescript for the frontend and nestjs for the backend.

In essence, Firfir Tera is a culinary haven, inviting users to explore, create, and enjoy a diverse array of flavors from around the world. Whether users seek comfort in familiar cuisines or wish to embark on new culinary adventures, Firfir Tera stands ready to facilitate their gastronomic journey.

We used JWT Token based Authentication and Authorization and used nestjs Guards for Role-based authentication.
